Securities issued by financial institutions are, as a rule, not eligible as collateral for SNB repos. However, covered bonds issued by financial institutions are admissible, provided the issuer is not a domestic financial institution or its foreign subsidiary. Also admissible are securities issued by the mortgage bond bank of the Swiss mortgage institutions and the mortgage bond institute of the Swiss cantonal banks.
(ii) The securities have a fixed-principal amount with unconditional redemption.
(iii) The securities have a fixed rate, floating rate or zero coupon.
(iv) The securities are traded on a recognised stock exchange or a representative market in Switzerland or a member state of the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA) or in the UK with price data published on a regular basis.
